The USB-C socket on both boards is a surface mount 16-pin USB-C socket. The sockets used on both boards are identical except for one thing.

The non-appended version numbers use a USB-C socket with two SMD pads for mechanical mounting to the PCB.

The "b" version uses a USB-C socket with four through hole pins for mechanical mounting to the PCB.

The latter is reported to be "stronger", although I've had no issue with USB-C sockets on either footprint for this application. 

See image in documentation if you're unsure which is which.
